# Great news! This HACS component is now deprecated and retired and has been replaced by the official [Airthings BLE integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/airthings_ble/)

Please remove this integration and use the official one in it's place

A big thank you to everyone who have helped support this integration, and a thank you to @vincegio for porting it into the official Home Assistant repository.
